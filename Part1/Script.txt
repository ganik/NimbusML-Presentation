Who knows / used ML.NET or TLC? pls raise your hands.

TLC is Microsoft proprietary machine learning library that is used across many product groups in Microsoft like Windows, Bing, Excel and many more.

ML.NET is open source version of TLC and contains almost all TLC features except few proprietary ones, for ex. Office developed tokenizers

There was a demand for TLC/ML.NET in Python. So we have developed python bindings and called it PyTLC and its open source version NimbusML.
As you can figure it out, PyTLC is a python bindings for TLC, while NimbusML is a python bindings for ML.NET
